Forest Plot wrapper for normami
================================

This is a set of scripts to let you run the forest plot extraction tools from ContentMine's normami toolset. It primarily consists of some tooling to generating Docker images of the normami toolset, and python scripts to run over them and generate output excel files with data from any forest plots found.
